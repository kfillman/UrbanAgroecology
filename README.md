Laboratory Exercises for Biology Students

This is a project I did for a 2022 summer internship where I was tasked with designing two labtratory exercises for undergraduate students. The basis of these labs was to test the effects of a new urban farm on the college's campus. The lab exercises, as a whole, aimed to gather and analyse data to answer this question. The first lab was aimed at first-semester biology students, aiming to introduce them to common ecological concepts and get them comfortable collecting data. The second lab was for upper-level students and aimed to teach them to analyse the data collected by the first lab using R and the 'vegan' package.
