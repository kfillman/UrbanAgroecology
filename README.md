Laboratory Exercises for Biology Students

This is a project I did for a 2022 summer internship where I was tasked with designing two labtratory exercises for undergraduate students. The first lab was aimed at first-semester biology students, aiming to introduce them to common ecological concepts and get them comfortable collecting data. The second lab was for upper-level students and aimed to teach them to analyse the data collected by the first lab using R and the 'vegan' package.
